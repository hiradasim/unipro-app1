## Simple Web Task Manager

A lightweight web version of a task manager is available in the
`simple_web` directory. Open `simple_web/index.html` in any modern browser
to add, complete, and remove tasks. Tasks are stored locally in the
browser using `localStorage` so they persist across sessions on the same
device.
